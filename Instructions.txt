Short explanation:

The Demo QA and Cheese test are completed. The Orange is partially done.

Test were created and run with Intellij and Junit on Google Chrome.

Running the test requires local drivers to be present.

I could not get the test to run from command line, even though Maven finds all 3 of them.
